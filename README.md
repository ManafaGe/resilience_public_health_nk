# Shiny Resilience GeoViz Tool 

This repository contains the code and data for the geovisualization tool developed for my Master's thesis. The tool visually represents the resilience index and sub-indices for the district Neuk√∂lln in Berlin in the context of public health emergencies.

## Overview

The project provides an interactive geovisualization tool to examine resilience indices, sub-indices, and individual indicators.  The tool can be used for exploration or to facilitate decision-making by health authorities. It can serve as an initial baseline to examine existing health-related resilience capacities, compare places of interest to one another, and determine specific factors of resilience across the neighborhoods.

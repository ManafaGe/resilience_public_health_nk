# Shiny Resilience Dashboard 

This repository contains the code and data for my Master's Thesis project's interactive dashboard. The dashboard visually represents the resilience index and sub-indices I developed for Berlin's Neuk√∂lln.

## Overview

The project employs geovisualization tools to enhance scientific communication and critical thinking. It provides an interactive geovisualization tool to explore resilience indices, sub-indices, and individual indicators. The tool facilitates decision-making for public health authorities, offering a baseline for assessing resilience to emergencies, enabling location comparisons, identifying specific resilience factors in neighborhoods, and tracking improvements over time.
